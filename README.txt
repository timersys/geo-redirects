Create Geo redirects in an incredible easy way and use different set of rules to match users

== Description ==
Geo redirects plugins it's much more than a simple geo plugin. You can create powerful redirections with the simple rules interface.

Rules available:


* Redirect based on City, country, states
* Redirect on specific pages, templates, posts, etc
* Redirect users from search engines
* Redirect users that never commented
* Redirect users that arrived via another page on your site
* Redirect users via roles
* Redirect depending on referrer
* Redirect to logged / non logged users
* Redirect or not to mobile, desktop and tablet users
* Redirect or not to bots / crawlers like Google
* Redirect or not depending on query strings EG: utm_source=email
* Redirect depending on post type, post template, post name, post format, post status and post taxonomy
* Redirect depending on page template, if page is parent, page name, page type
